        <p>
            Tax incentives have long been a cornerstone of economic development policy in St. Louis. From tax increment 
            financing (TIF) to tax abatements, these tools are designed to spur investment, create jobs, and revitalize 
            struggling neighborhoods. But too often, our current system fails to deliver on these promises while draining 
            public resources and deepening inequities.
        </p>

        <p>
            After years of working on tax incentive policy as Special Assistant to the Mayor, Director of Policy, and 
            now as Executive Director of the Community Development Administration, I've seen both the potential and the 
            pitfalls of these programs. It's time for comprehensive reform.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem with Our Current System</h2>

        <p>
            St. Louis's tax incentive framework suffers from three fundamental flaws:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Lack of Accountability</h3>
        <p>
            We frequently approve incentives without rigorous "but-for" analysis—that is, we don't adequately determine 
            whether the development would happen <em>without</em> public subsidy. Once approved, we rarely track whether 
            projects deliver promised jobs, investment, or community benefits. There are few consequences for developers 
            who fail to meet their commitments.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Equity Blind Spots</h3>
        <p>
            Our incentive programs rarely consider who benefits from development. Do projects create quality jobs accessible 
            to residents who need them most? Do they prevent displacement or exacerbate it? Are we investing equally across 
            neighborhoods or concentrating resources in already advantaged areas? Too often, we don't ask these questions.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Minimal Community Input</h3>
        <p>
            Community members most affected by development decisions have little meaningful voice in the process. By the 
            time neighbors learn about a proposed incentive, deals are often finalized. This undermines democratic 
            accountability and leads to projects that don't serve community needs.
        </p>

        <h2>A Five-Point Framework for Reform</h2>

        <p>
            Here's what comprehensive tax incentive reform should look like:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Rigorous Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Every incentive application should include independent analysis demonstrating that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The project would not proceed without public subsidy (true "but-for")</li>
            <li>The public return on investment exceeds the cost over a reasonable timeframe</li>
            <li>The project doesn't merely relocate activity from elsewhere in the region</li>
            <li>Alternative uses of public funds were considered</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Equity Impact Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            All incentive proposals should be evaluated through an equity lens:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What percentage of jobs will be accessible to residents earning below area median income?</li>
            <li>Does the project include affordable housing components or anti-displacement measures?</li>
            <li>Are local and minority-owned businesses included in development and ongoing operations?</li>
            <li>How does the project affect existing residents and small businesses?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Meaningful Community Engagement</h3>
        <p>
            Community input should be required <strong>early</strong> in the process, not as an afterthought:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Notice to neighborhood organizations and residents within 1/2 mile</li>
            <li>Public meetings held in the affected community at accessible times</li>
            <li>Written community impact assessments</li>
            <li>Community benefit agreements for large projects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Clawback and Enforcement Mechanisms</h3>
        <p>
            Developers should face real consequences for failing to deliver:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear, enforceable job creation and investment targets</li>
            <li>Annual compliance reporting requirements</li>
            <li>Automatic clawback provisions triggered by non-compliance</li>
            <li>Dedicated staff for monitoring and enforcement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Geographic Equity and Caps</h3>
        <p>
            We should ensure incentives don't simply flow to the most advantaged neighborhoods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set aside a percentage of incentive funding for historically disinvested communities</li>
            <li>Establish higher subsidy thresholds for projects in well-served areas</li>
            <li>Cap the total amount of incentives available citywide annually</li>
            <li>Regular reporting on the geographic distribution of incentives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Making Reform Real</h2>

        <p>
            This framework isn't radical—it reflects best practices from cities across the country. Chicago, Boston, 
            and Minneapolis have all implemented versions of these reforms. St. Louis can and should do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            The political path forward requires coalition-building among community advocates, progressive alderpersons, 
            labor organizations, and reform-minded business leaders. We've passed significant policy reforms before—on 
            civilian oversight, on marijuana decriminalization, on short-term rentals. We can do it again.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tax incentives aren't inherently bad. When deployed strategically, they can catalyze transformative development. 
            But we must ensure they serve the public interest, advance equity, and earn community trust. The reforms I've 
            outlined here would move us significantly closer to that goal.
        </p>
